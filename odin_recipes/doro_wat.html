    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Doro Wot is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from tender chicken and boiled eggs stewed in aromatic berbere spice .</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken thighs cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 onion minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper diced</li>
        <li>6 eggs hard boiled</li>
        <li>1 lemon zest and juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp berbere</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First hard boil the eggs (place in a pot with cold water,
             bring to a boil, cover, remove from heat, let sit for 
             12-14 minutes, rinse with cold water, and then peel).</li>
        <li>On a large foil-lined sheet, broil chicken cubes for 
            ~3 minutes (they donâ€™t have to be cooked completely, 
            this is just to draw out some excess water).</li>
        <li>In a separate large pan, saute garlic and ginger paste 
            with onions and bell peppers in infused oil for 5 minutes
            or until onions become golden. Then add the tomato paste
            and berbere, sauteeing for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>At this point, add the chicken and lemon zest/juice and 
            stir to coat. Place a lid on the pan and cook on low heat,
            stirring intermittently, for about 20 minutes or until 
            chicken is tender and cooked through. Depending on your 
            desired consistency, you can continue cooking with the 
            lid off for a few more minutes to thicken the sauce. 
            When ready, season with salt/pepper, add eggs, and 
            serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
