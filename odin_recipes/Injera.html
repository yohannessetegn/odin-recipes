    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><i><abbr title="Ethiopian Fermented Flatbread">injera</abbr></i>, the national dish of Ethiopia, is a delicious spongy sourdough bread made from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teff"><i><abbr title="Eragrostis tef">teff</abbr></i></a><!--define or do something about it--> flour.</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teff"><i><abbr title="Eragrostis tef">teff</abbr></i></a> flour</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li >Add yeast to ½ cup room temperature water in a large 
            bowl and mix together until foamy. Add <a href=""><i><abbr title="Eragrostis tef">teff</abbr></i></a> and all 
            purpose flour to the bowl along with salt, baking powder, 
            and 2.5 more cups water. <em>Stir until a uniform mixture</em>.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl loosely and let sit/ferment at room temp 
            for <strong>2 days</strong>. During this time, the water and flour will 
            naturally separate a bit, bubbles will start to form, 
            and it will start to smell slightly sour 
            (this is a good sign, just like making s
            our dough bread).</li>
        <li>After 48 hours, uncover bowl and stir to combine. 
            The desired consistency is thicker than a crepe 
            mixture but thinner than a pancake mixture. You 
            may need to add a bit more water to reach this 
            consistency.</li>
        <li>Place a large <strong>nonstick pan</strong> (<em>that comes with a lid</em>) 
            on the stove on medium-high heat and spray with some oil.
             Ladle in enough of the mixture to just barely coat the 
             bottom of the pan. Cook for about 30 seconds or until 
             bubbles are forming and then cover with a lid to steam. 
             Let steam for about 1-2 minutes or until the center 
             looks cooked through.</li>
        <li>Set aside <i><abbr title="Ethiopian Fermented Flatbread">injera</abbr></i> to cool and repeat this process 
            for the remaining mixture.</li>
    </ol>
